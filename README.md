# Tribute-Page
This is my project submission for an assignment where I had to create a tribute page which demonstrated basic CSS and HTML skills. I completed all assigned tasks for the project which can be verified on the live site with the task checker in the top left (simply select the Tribute Page project and Run Tests).

You can view the live site at the following URL: https://mjihaduddin00.github.io/Tribute-Page/

Thanks!
